ENEL300 Project 4 Boebot arduino code

So the master branch is what's going on the robot
To change the master branch:

1. Make a new branch
2. Add in whatever code you like
3. Submit a pull request (the master pulls in your branch)
4. Pull request gets reviewed and approved (BY ME, HAHAH)
5. Your code gets put into the master branch for good(ish)
6. Done!
